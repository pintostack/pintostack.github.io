# Get your cloud up and running!

As an engineering manager I donâ€™t want my team to be blocked with environment setup tasks or depend on DevOps. 

As a developer I want to build and ship my apps that run on my system, dev and prod the same way. 

As a DevOps I want to have a software defined, high availability and fault-tolerant, immutable infrastructure which I can develop and build on my local machine the same way I would do that in the cloud.

As data enthusiast I want my Spark and HDFS cluster up and running so I could hack on cool public data.
