# What is PintoStack?

It all started with trying to setup a scalable testing environment for [DeviceHive](http://devicehive.com) where we could independently run our application containers, test containers, and infrastructure: Cassandra and Kafka. Something we can play with locally, ensure it runs property and set to a real test in public cloud. After extensive search, everything we found was too provider specific and required extensive background knowledge. Docker swarm, docker compose, chef, puppet, you name it. Thatâ€™s when the work has started. PintoStack combines everything we need to run high availability and fault tolerant immutable infrastructure with service discovery, where Docker Containers are the first class citizens:

* Apache Mesos for resource management
* Foo
* Marathon for long running task management 
* Chronos for scheduled tasks (TBD)
* Private docker registry
* All logging is collected into ELK stack (TBD)
* Sample containers for:
  * Apache Spark + Apache Zeppelin
  * HDFS
  * Kafka
  * Cassandra
